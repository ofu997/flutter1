# Item Lister

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Item Lister grants you entry through email authentication. It allows you to make entries of whatever you like. For each item you can describe it, name its price, include a photo, and map it. Each unique user can create, edit, delete, and "like" items of his/her choice, while being able to see all items posted by other users.
